# MiniShell

## Description

In computing, a shell serves as a user interface for accessing an operating system's services. Operating system shells typically utilize either a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI), depending on the computer's role and specific operation. The term "shell" is aptly chosen as it represents the outermost layer around the operating system kernel. This project aims to build a CLI shell interface, handling a set of simple commands for execution.


### Implementation Details
Some implementation details may deviate from what one might encounter in building a high-performing, widely-used product. The emphasis here is on exploring various system interfaces, even if the solution may not be optimal in a real-world context.
